# Anti++ Layout
A keyboard layout for onscreen programming

Q: How do you code on a TabletPC without a keyboard?  
A: Not very efficiently!

Anti++ eases the pain a little bit through:
- Freqeunt letters near the center position left. Inspired/Based on [Enti-Key aka Coffee++](http://coffeeplusplus.z11.de/)
- Frequent programming symbols on the right side, top level. The are also sorted e.g. brackets next to each other.
- Numbers should be used from Numpad. Alternativly they are in the AltGr layer as:
-- Numpad in the center of the keyboard
-- additionally 1 to 6 in theyr default poitions at the top row
- Just like [ENTI-Key](http://coffeeplusplus.z11.de/) and [Neo Layout](https://www.neo-layout.org/) it is based on German (ä... ß...).
- However, since most Coding Languages are English: Y and other "english" Letters get priority positions
- < here is a link to one research site that listed Symbols in common programming laguages by frequency > 
- It is listed under EN(UK) ... See below if you want it to show up under a different Language

## Installation
### Windows
- Download the files in the Win folder
- run one of the setups appropriate for your system
### Custom Windows
- Download the .klc file
- Download and install [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339)
- Load .klc through "load source file"
- Customize away. You can also change the Locale/Language
- Hit Project/Build DLL and Setup
### Linux
- WIP on xmodmap...

### Issues
- Win10: Keyboard shortcuts are on their old POSITION, so "Paste" is Ctrl+o ... may or may not be desirable.

## In Action
- Using osk.exe from Win7 (can be started via Cortana/Search). I recommend it over the default Win8+ keyboard, because it can float and be resized. Perfect for Pen input.

- Using the Windows 8/10 "Touch" keyboard. Which is always super huge and clumsy, even in Portrait mode...
